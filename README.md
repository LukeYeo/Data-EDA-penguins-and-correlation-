# Data-EDA-penguins-and-correlation-
Description: 
Using the dataset of the penguin , I perform a basic in depth analysis in regards to the different data that was in the dataset. 
I wrote my reasons as to why i use certain technique and observation throughout the entire project


Skills set used: 
- Basic Cleaning of dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysus (EDA) : Univariate EDA, Bivariate EDA , EDA by species
- Correlations: Pearason , spearman, Kendall
- K-mean clustering of certain chosen correlations
- Prinicple component analysis
